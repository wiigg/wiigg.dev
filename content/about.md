My name is Danny Wigg, and I'm based in one of the leafy home counties of London, UK. I'm a software engineer, technology stategist, and solution architect at Microsoft. I also studied computer science at the University of Pennsylvania.

I am strong believer in not only using technology to solve interesting problems, but getting it into the hands of people who can benefit from it the most.

Whenever I'm not in front of a computer, you may find me going for a run, hitting the trails for a hike, enjoying a good book, trying to improve my German, or studying something new that's caught my interest.

If you'd like to get in touch, please contact me via hello \[at] wiigg \[dot] dev.
