Hello! My name is Danny Wigg and I am a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft, based in the leafy outskirts of London, UK. I recently attained a Master's degree in Computer Science, and am grateful for the opportunity to use my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on the world.

Throughout my career, I have focused on technology strategy and solution engineering, constantly seeking out new and innovative ways to improve and optimise systems. I am deeply passionate about software development and environmental sustainability, and believe that we have the power to create meaningful change through the work that we do.

In my free time, you may find me going for a run, enjoying a good book, or hitting the trails for a hike. I am always up for trying new things and staying active.

If you'd like to get in touch, the best way to reach me is via email at hello \[at] wiigg \[dot] dev. I am always open to connecting with like-minded professionals and discussing new opportunities. Thank you for stopping by!
